# MAPS_HID_INJECTION

This C++ file is intended for Grant M Bowler Elementary.
The purpose is to provide HID injection capabilities to an
Arduino Pro Micro or Leonardo microcontroller to facilitate
faster logins for client machines. 
Edit the credentials in the code, then compile and flash it
to your device using the Arduino IDE. Then simply plug-in and
inject.
